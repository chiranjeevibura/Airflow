Slide 4: Key Concepts
DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
DAGs represent workflows in Apache Airflow.
A DAG is a collection of tasks with defined dependencies between them.
Tasks are executed in a specific order based on their dependencies and scheduling parameters.
Airflow ensures that DAGs are acyclic, meaning there are no cycles or loops in the workflow.
Operators
Operators define the actions to be performed as part of a task in a DAG.
Airflow provides a wide range of built-in operators for common tasks such as Bash commands, Python functions, SQL queries, and more.
Custom operators can be defined to execute custom logic or interact with external systems and services.
Tasks
Tasks are instances of operators within a DAG.
Each task represents a specific unit of work that needs to be executed.
Tasks can have dependencies on other tasks within the same DAG, defining the order of execution.
Executors
Executors are responsible for executing tasks within a DAG.
Airflow supports different types of executors, including SequentialExecutor, LocalExecutor, CeleryExecutor, and KubernetesExecutor.
The executor determines how tasks are executed and scaled across the Airflow cluster.
Sensors
Sensors are special types of operators that wait for a certain condition to be met before proceeding with execution.
Sensors are useful for waiting on external systems or events, such as file availability, database records, or API responses.
Examples of sensors include FileSensor, HttpSensor, and ExternalTaskSensor.
Hooks
Hooks provide a unified interface for interacting with external systems and services from within Airflow tasks.
Hooks encapsulate the logic for connecting to and communicating with external systems, such as databases, cloud services, and APIs.
Hooks abstract away the details of interacting with different systems, making it easier to develop portable and reusable workflows.
Speaker Notes:
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are the core abstraction in Apache Airflow, representing workflows as a collection of tasks with dependencies.
Operators define the actions to be performed within tasks, while tasks represent individual units of work in a workflow.
Executors determine how tasks are executed and scaled across the Airflow cluster, with different executors offering different scalability and isolation models.
Sensors provide a mechanism for waiting on external conditions before proceeding with task execution, enabling workflows to react to changes in the environment or external events.
Hooks simplify the process of interacting with external systems and services from within Airflow tasks, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
